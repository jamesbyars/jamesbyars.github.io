While visiting Memphis, TN our Uber driver from the night before told us about 
[Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken](http://gusfriedchicken.com) and the guy seemed to know what he was 
 talking about so we decided to give it a try.
 
The outside of the building spoke to me, I don't like really fancy places, I care 
about what is in the inside...the food!
