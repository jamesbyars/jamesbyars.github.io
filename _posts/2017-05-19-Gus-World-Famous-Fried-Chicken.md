While visiting Memphis, TN our Uber driver from the night before told us about 
[Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken](http://gusfriedchicken.com) and the guy seemed to know what he was 
 talking about so we decided to give it a try.
 
The outside of the building spoke to me, I don't like really fancy places, I care 
about what is in the inside...the food!

Inside feels just like it should, cozy, southern, like a southern kitchen.

I chose the 3 piece white meat plate, and opted for two helpings of mac-n-cheese instead of 
beans and coleslaw - As recommended by our driver who claimed that, "you don't go there 
for the sides, Mac-N-Cheese is the only one worth getting."

Gus's is known for their Hot Chicken, meaning the breading has a bit of a kick to it.  Some 
of those who dined with me thought it was hot, I added plenty of Louisiana Hot Sauce in order 
to bring it up to a satisfactory level.

We finished off the mean with a deep fried blueberry pie.  Was it good?  I guess.  I would 
have preferred Strawberry or Apple.

Let me tell you, there will be a brick in your stomach after putting this one away!
