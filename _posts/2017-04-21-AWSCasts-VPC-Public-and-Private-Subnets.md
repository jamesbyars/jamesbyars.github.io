I've decided to start building a tutorial series in which I target intermediate Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
subjects.  I've found that there are a lot of beginner focused AWS tutorials out there, but not many focused 
on intermediate and advanced users.  This tutorial is the first of (hopefully) many.  I'm looking for users 
to request content they are interested in learning more about whether it be in the comments below or in the 
comments section of YouTube.  Thanks for watching and I hope I can help you learn more about AWS!
