"Never satisfied and always thirsting for knowledge and continuous improvement" -> this 
phrase defines me better than any other set of words in the english language.  I believe 
it is both my reason for success and my biggest weakness.  And that is OK.

I'm always reflecting on where I can improve in both my life and my career, how can I be 
more efficient, what can I learn that will give me an advantage.  Over the past three 
years I can point to one single activity that has benefited me the most in both my personal 
and professional life: RUNNING.

I started running 3 years ago and couldn't run for more than half a mile at a time.  I 
persevered through soreness, ankle injury, knee pain, shin splints, 100 degree summers, 
and 10 degree winters.  I've emerged as a strong runner and just completed my first 
half-marathon, an accomplishment of which I am very proud.
