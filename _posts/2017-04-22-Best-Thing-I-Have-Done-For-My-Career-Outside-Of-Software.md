"Never satisfied and always thirsting for knowledge and continuous improvement" -- this 
phrase defines me better than any other set of words in the english language.  I believe 
it is both my reason for success and my biggest weakness.  And that is OK.

I'm always reflecting on where I can improve in both my life and my career, how can I be 
more efficient, what can I learn that will give me an advantage.  Over the past three 
years I can point to one single activity that has benefited me the most in both my personal 
and professional life: RUNNING.

I started running 3 years ago and couldn't run for more than half a mile at a time.  I 
persevered through soreness, ankle injury, knee pain, shin splints, 100 degree summers, 
and 10 degree winters.  I've emerged as a strong runner and just completed my first 
half-marathon, an accomplishment of which I am very proud.

I've noticed that I'm mentally stronger, I refuse to give up.  When I'm tackling a hard 
problem at work, I'm more patient and that is important.  When I'm struggling to keep up 
in my personal life and things get hard, I know I can make it because I've already 
practiced my "never quit" attitude.

## How I run

I have a couple rules for running

1. Never stop - this is the most important, when I run, I never stop and walk.  If things get
 hard and I need to catch my breath I may slow down, but I never stop.
2. Set and follow SMART goals.  If you don't know what SMART goals are I suggest stopping 
reading here and look it up.

That's it, two rules.  Never quit and always be working towards a goal.
