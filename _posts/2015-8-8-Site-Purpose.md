### Purpose

Through my daily (and nightly) work I encounter problems.  Keeping with software engineer 
style, Google.com is my best friend.  What I find time and time again are StackOverflow 
questions marked as duplicates, blog posts from 3 years ago, and '10 mortgage tips your 
bank doesn't want you to know'.  Even in my personal work, I have hit similar issues and 
thought to myself, "How did I solve that one?"  Enough is enough, I'm starting my own 
list of learnings, common implementations, etc...
