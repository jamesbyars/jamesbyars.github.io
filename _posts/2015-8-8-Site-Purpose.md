title: Creature of Habit - My Purpose and Vision
---

# I love patterns

I would call myself a creature of habit - just listen to my morning routine...

* Wake up, walk downstairs
* Make 6 cups of coffee
* Pee
* Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich (Smucker's Seedless Blackberry Raspberry & Smooth JIF)
* Pour my coffee over 1 ice cube
* Sit in my spot at the table and proceed with breakfast
* Take my shower and go to work

To me, this makes logical sense.  I know that from the time I wake up until the time I leave 
for work 35 minutes go by, and I know it works - I've been doing it for years!

## I'm not alone!

I'm not the only one who finds comfort in patterns.  As a Software Engineer I study and 
implement design patters.  Design Patters provide a common, proven, peer reviewed solutions
to common problems.  

## Purpose

Through my daily (and nightly) work I encounter problems.  Keeping with software engineer 
style, Google.com is my best friend.  What I find time and time again are StackOverflow 
questions marked as duplicates, blog posts from 3 years ago, and '10 mortgage tips your 
bank doesn't want you to know'.  Even in my personal work, I have hit similar issues and 
thought to myself, "How did I solve that one?"  Enough is enough, I'm starting my own 
list of learnings, common implementations, etc...
