As a programmer I think one of the most important attributes one can have is consistency 
and the ability to analyze situations.  Through my career I have found a consistant set 
of problems faced in projects. 



### Creature of Habit

I would call myself a creature of habit - just listen to my morning routine...

* Wake up, walk downstairs
* Make 6 cups of coffee
* Pee
* Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich (Smucker's Seedless Blackberry Raspberry & Smooth JIF)
* Pour my coffee over 1 ice cube
* Sit in my spot at the table and proceed with breakfast
* Take my shower and go to work

To me, this makes logical sense.  I know that from the time I wake up until the time I leave 
for work 35 minutes go by, and I know it works - I've been doing it for years!

### I'm not alone!

I'm not the only one who finds comfort in patterns.  As a Software Engineer I study and 
implement design patters.  Design Patters provide a common, proven, peer reviewed solution 
to common problems.  Many highly skilled engineers I have talked to recommend learning 
design patterns as one of the best way to improve one's skills.  

Writers of [Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), 
aka "The Gang of Four Book", recognized the need for patterns and published their book way back 
in 1994.  Personally, I am a big fan of the [Head First Series](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/head-first.do), 
so I chose to start with [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do).  


### I love patterns

With software patterns I am able to analyze the task at hand and choose the appropriate 
solution.  The solutions follow a consistant implementation and are open to customization 
to meet project requirements.
