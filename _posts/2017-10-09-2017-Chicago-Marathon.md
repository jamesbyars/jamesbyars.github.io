I ran my first marathon in 2017 - it was the Bank of America Chicago Marathon and
it was incredible.  I am going to write a little about the experience so others
so I remember it better and so others can enjoy.

# Why did I decide to do this?

If you have been following my posts you know that I have been running for a
couple years now.  I started with a 5k and worked my way up to a 10k and
half-marathon.  I was never really sure that I wanted to run a marathon
because I knew how much strain it put on the body.  With the encouragement of
others I decided to join the Ronald McDonald House charity race team.  In
exchange for being able to register for the race (normally one must qualify),
I pledged to raise $1500 in order to keep families close.

# Marathon Training

The charity race team provided us with a self assessment and based on the
results recommended a training plan put together by a professional running
coach.  The plan was very similar to what you might find when looking for
plans online.

I began training months in advance, gradually increasing my mileage.  Working
through the different workouts specified in the training plan.  I travel a lot
for work so it proved challenging to adhere strictly to the plan - I did my
best.  

Throughout the training I dealt with pain.  From blisters to knee pain, to
shin splints, I just had to persevere.

# Race Day

I woke up extra early in order to make it to the pre-race hospitality tent
provided by Ronald McDonald House Charities.  Nutrition is very important
and even though I don't always eat the best wanted to make sure my body had
what it needed for the event.

It was about a 35 minute walk to the hospitality tent that morning - I think
I left the hotel at 5:30 AM.

From there I went to the starting line, all runners are grouped into a
corral - I was in 'H'.  Once our time to start came, we made our way up
to the starting line and waited for the official 'GO!'.

The first 13 miles flew by, I had a great pace going and was thinking all
would be well.  Was I ever wrong.  Starting in the 13th mile my knees began
to feel swollen.  Each step shot pain through my knee.  By the time I got to
mile 14 I decided that I needed to let the pain die down so I slowed to a
brisk walk.  

I began to feel encouraged as the pain went away after about half a mile.  I
start to run, wanting to get back into my groove from the first half.  About a
quarter mile later my hamstrings locked up - cramps, mainly in my left leg.  I
had no choice but to walk, limping heavily.  A police officer monitoring the
course asked me if I was OK - of course I said I was fine, just a cramp.

As I worked the cramp out I decided to pick up running again and was OK doing
so.  Until about a half-mile later, when the cramps came back.  This was
somewhere in mile 15.  I walked, waited for the cramps to subside, then ran
until they came back.  

I did this cycle from mile 15 - 24.  It.  Was.  Miserable.  At one point
around mile 19 I remember being so exhausted and in so much pain that when
attempting to wipe some sweat off my nose with my hand I missed my entire
face.  I went back again, after laughing of course, and I missed a second
time.  This scared me a bit, but I had been informed of the effects running
for extended periods would have on the brain.  I persevered.

Finally, I see mile 24 coming up.  I have been doing this run/walk thing for
a few hours now over nearly 10 miles.  I wanted to finish strong.  I was not
going to walk across that finish line.  I started to run, craps and all, and
I did not stop until I crossed that line.

# Post Race

I cried, but no tears came out.  I cannot explain what came over me, but I
cried.  I was too dehydrated for tears to exist.  As I made my way back to
the hospitality tent I was so excited to find somewhere to sit.  Being on your
feet, running, for 5 hours and 15 minutes is a lot.

I did it.
